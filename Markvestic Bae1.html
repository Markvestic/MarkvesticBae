            Good! I love to teach you HTML! Firstly we need to know the meaning of HTML!<br> 
            HTML stands for <strong><i>Hyper Text Markup Language,</i></strong> which is the most widely used language on the web to develop web pages.
            Hypertext means that the document contains links that allow the reader to jump to other places in the document or another document altogether.
